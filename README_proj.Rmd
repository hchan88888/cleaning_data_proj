This README describes the components of this project and how to run the program.

The submitted files consist of an R file named run_analysis.R, a code book, an output file named tidydata.txt, and this document.

To generate output:

1.  From UCI HAR Dataset folder, extract features.txt and activity_labels.txt.
2.  From subfolder train, extract subject_train.txt, X_train.txt and y_train.txt.
3.  From subfolder test, extract subject_test.txt, X_test.txt and y_test.txt.
4.  Set working directory by typing 
```    
setwd(your_directory_path).
```
5.  Put all the above data files in that directory.
6.  Put run_analysis.R in the same directory.
7.  At console, type 
```
source("run_analysis.R")
```
8.  To run, type
```
run_analysis()
```

To view output:

1.  Make sure tidydata.txt is in the working directory
2.  Type
```
data <- read.table("tidydata.txt", header = TRUE)
```
3. Type
```
View(data)
```
